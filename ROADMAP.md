# Roadmap

This document is meant to provide high-level but actionable objectives for future kube-aws deveploment.
Please file an issue to make suggestions on this roadmap!

## Every stage

  * Provide article walking users through:
    * setting up a cluster from scratch
    * using/enabling new features
    * (breaking changes)

## Stage 1: v0.9.2

  * Node Pools
    * Worker nodes optionally powered by Spot Fleet
  * Clean cluster upgrades (preventing downtime, make sure they succeed)

## Stage 2: v0.9.3

  * Kubernetes 1.5.1
     * Auto-scaled kube-dns
  * Self-hosted Calico
  * Very limited, almost theoretical support for automatic reconfiguration of cluster-autoscaler

## Stage 3: v0.9.4

  * Cluster Auto Scaling
    * Support for auto-scaling worker nodes with dynamic reconfiguration of cluster-autoscaler
  * Work-around the 16KB userdata limit in size
  * Experimental support for
    * Private subnets and NAT gateways for etcd, controller and worker nodes
    * Deployments to existing subnets

## Stage 4: v0.9.5

  * Rethink how node pools are implemented
    * See https://github.com/coreos/kube-aws/issues/238
  * Internal domain and custom hostnames support for etcd nodes?
  * etcd improvements
    * Backups
    * Recovery
  
## Stage 5: v0.9.6

  * Kubernetes 1.6
  * Etcd v3 support as it is enabled by default in 1.6: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/22448#event-913208648
  * Migrate from coreos-cloudinit to ignition for node bootstrapping
  * YAML CloudFormation templates

## Stage N: v0.9.x

  * Bootkube switch
    * `kube-aws` can largely go into maintenance mode when k8s upgrades can be safely achieved on self-hosted clusters.
